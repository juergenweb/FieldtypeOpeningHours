### Adding the module to the module directory
After I had published the module a lot of time ago, no issues will be reported. Now it is time to add this module
to the PW module directory. Some changes/improvements has been done, so I set the status to beta at the moment, but it
should be stable.

- making the module working with new PHP 8.2 version
- Improve the code by adding union types, so it needs at least PHP 8.0 to work
